## What it does
Activity-Charge solves the issue by giving inspiration to the customer (tourist) to couple sight seeing and traveling with frequent charging. The result is:
- 1️⃣ a better customer experience, as he has to worry less about the battery status due to combining trips with charging stops
- 2️⃣ higher probability that the car will be returned to Sixt with a somewhat loaded battery so the car can be rent by the next customers sooner


### How we built it
We developed a React Native crossplatform Mobile Application for Android and iOS. Our Backend exists out of a Python Flask server with a smart web scraping algorithm to find decent attractions which are next to a charger (less than 10 minutes on food from charter to the attraction).
